      The following is a quick note about (cold) emailing professors.  You have undoubtedly seen that many professors have notes on their websites that simply say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt email me.‚Äù I‚Äôd like to encourage you to <b><i>selectively</i></b> ignore that advice but understand why, when and how. <div style="float: right; clear: right;">(updated <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/245710-underrepresented-minority-considered-harmful-racist-language/fulltext">phrasing</a> 05/05/2021)</div>

              Success in academia, like many aspects of society, is often a function of who you know and networking.  Students of famous professors don‚Äôt need to email because they know their applications will get read carefully. Further, they may have had the opportunity to meet potential advisors at conferences and so they are already well connected when applying.  If you don‚Äôt fit this description, as many of us don‚Äôt,
              <br>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>How are you supposed to break into the ‚Äúin-group‚Äù? </li>
                <li>How is someone from a smaller lab, a different discipline, or an underrepresented group supposed to change the field?</li>
              </ul>

              They have to email.  They have to take the chance of getting no reply to at least put themselves out there.  If this is you, please email me and everyone else.

              Professors get lots of emails, that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre reading this.  Many of them are generic and have nothing to do with their specific research.  Let‚Äôs say a professor works 40hrs a week and works with 10 students/collaborators.  
              <ul>
                <li>40 - 10hrs of collaboration meetings = 30hrs.</li>
                <li>3hrs teaching, 6hrs preparing, & one office hour = 20hrs left.</li>
                <li>Thesis committees, graduate admissions, hiring, rec letters, ‚Ä¶ = 10hrs.  </li>
                <li>Grant writing and staying current on the literature‚Ä¶ = 0hrs.  </li>
              </ul>

              All of these things actually take much longer than what I‚Äôve listed and are worse around paper and grant deadlines, but we still haven‚Äôt budgeted any time to reply to emails from our collaborators or anybody else.  This means, a professor likely is reading your email while eating lunch, on the bus on the way home, or at night when they are trying to figure out what they forgot to do today.  So, a useful exercise might be to ask yourself: 
              <ol>
                <li>How much time does it take to reply to the email I‚Äôm sending?</li>
                <li>Is this email actually a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">DOS attack</a>?  [i.e. did it take me much less time to write than it will for them to reply?]</li>
              </ol>

              No, maybe, it's complicated.  I think we need to talk a little about how admissions works (YMMV at other institutions).<br><br>
              Every school has an admissions committees that does the initial ranking and sorting of candidates.  At LTI/RI this is done by faculty, at UIUC and UWashington, this is done ( at least in part ) by current graduate students.
              I will read every single application that mentions my name in the statement of purpose.  For some faculty that might just be 50-75, for others, it may be several hundred applications.  
              I will also try and read every application that mentions keywords that are relevant to my research -- further increasing my load.  
              This process involves reading your statements, your transcript/resume/CV, your letters of recommendation, and possibly skimming a paper you've written.
              This takes <i><b>a long</b></i> time and honestly, this means that we might not get to spend as much time on your application as you were hoping we would.  Here's where your email helps or hurts:<br><br>
              
              <center><i>
              If I get an email that <b>meets</b> the above criteria -- I give the application a closer look. That's it.
              </i></center>

              <br>
              It's not nothing, but it might not be what you were hoping for.
              I do not have the ability to unilaterally admit you to the PhD/MLT program.  
              If we are a really good match I can try and put my thumb on the scale, but once admitted, you're under no obligation to work with me (this is a good thing!). 
              But that means that I can't be the only person who is willing to work with you either.  
              This creates a preference for applications that are "broadly" strong and that several faculty agree would be successful if admitted.
