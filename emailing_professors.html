      The following is a quick note about (cold) emailing professors.  You have undoubtedly seen that many 
      professors have notes on their websites that simply say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt email me.‚Äù I‚Äôd like to encourage you to 
      <b><i>selectively</i></b> ignore that advice but understand why, when and how.

      I've attempted to organize this into a two informational sections (more to come):

                          Success in academia, like many aspects of society, is often a function of who you 
                          know and networking.  Students of famous professors don‚Äôt need to email because 
                          they know their applications will get read carefully. Further, they may have had 
                          the opportunity to meet potential advisors at conferences and so they are already 
                          well connected when applying.  If you don‚Äôt fit this description, as many of us don‚Äôt,
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          <ul>
                            <li>How are you supposed to break into the ‚Äúin-group‚Äù? </li>
                            <li>How is someone from a smaller lab, a different discipline, or an underrepresented
                                group supposed to change the field?</li>
                          </ul>

                          They have to email.  They have to take the chance of getting no reply to at least put 
                          themselves out there.  If this is you, please email me and everyone else.
                        </div>
                      </div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="card">
                      <div class="card-header" id="headingTwo">

                          Professors get lots of emails, that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre reading this.  Many of them are 
                          generic and have nothing to do with their specific research.  Let‚Äôs say a professor 
                          works 40hrs a week and works with 10 students/collaborators.  
                          <ul>
                            <li>40 - 10hrs of collaboration meetings = 30hrs.</li>
                            <li>3hrs teaching, 6hrs preparing, & one office hour = 20hrs left.</li>
                            <li>Thesis committees, graduate admissions, hiring, rec letters, ‚Ä¶ = 10hrs.  </li>
                            <li>Grant writing and staying current on the literature‚Ä¶ = 0hrs.  </li>
                          </ul>

                          All of these things actually take much longer than what I‚Äôve listed and are worse 
                          around paper and grant deadlines, but we still haven‚Äôt budgeted any time to reply 
                          to emails from our collaborators or anybody else.  This means, a professor likely 
                          is reading your email while eating lunch, on the bus on the way home, or at night
                          when they are trying to figure out what they forgot to do today.  So, a useful 
                          exercise might be to ask yourself: 
                          <ol>
                            <li>How much time does it take to reply to the email I‚Äôm sending?</li>
                            <li>Is this email actually a <a href="https://w.wiki/3iDA">DOS attack</a>?  
                              [i.e. did it take me much less time to write than it will for them to reply?]</li>
                          </ol>

                          <br>

                          No, maybe, it's complicated.  I think we need to talk a little about how admissions 
                          works (YMMV at other institutions).<br><br>
                          Every school has an admissions committees that does the initial ranking and sorting of 
                          candidates.  At LTI/RI this is done by faculty, at UIUC and UWashington, this is 
                          done ( at least in part ) by current graduate students. I will look at every 
                          application that mentions my name in the statement of purpose (in round 3 -- see below).  
                          For some faculty that might just be a few dozen, for others, it may be a large chunk 
                          of the applicant pool. I will also try and read every application that mentions 
                          keywords that are relevant to my research -- further increasing my load.  
                          This process involves reading your statements, your transcript/resume/CV, your 
                          letters of recommendation, and possibly skimming a paper you've written.
                          This takes <i><b>a long</b></i> time and honestly, this means that we might not get 
                          to spend as much time on your application as you were hoping we would.  
                          Here's where your email helps or hurts:<br><br>

                          <center><i>
                              If I get an email that <b>meets</b> the above criteria -- I give the application 
                              a closer look. That's it.
                            </i></center>

                            <br>
                            It's not nothing, but it might not be what you were hoping for.
                            I do not have the ability to unilaterally admit you to the PhD/MLT program.  
                            If we are a really good match I can try and put my thumb on the scale, but once 
                            admitted, you're under no obligation to work with me (this is a good thing!). 
                            But that means that I can't be the only person who is willing to work with you either.  
                            This creates a preference for applications that are "broadly" strong and that 
                            several faculty agree would be successful if admitted.

                          <b>Meeting at a conference?</b> Great idea! At a conference our schedule is 
                          already cleared for talks and social events so it's /much/ easier to find time to 
                          meet with prospective students.

                          of other things might eat into their time and so they may not take anybody that year.

                              Regardless of when you're reading this, you already have started your application. 
                              A common mistake is to think that you can just sorta "pull things together" in 
                              your senior year.  Hopefully after you read the sections below, it'll become clear
                              why that's not the case, but here's some basic math. If you wanted to have a 
                              published paper included in your application in November, you'd need to have 
                              received the acceptance notice by early November, which is typically at least 
                              three months after submission (i.e. August). And if everything went perfectly, 
                              you'd still need at least 6 months to do and write up the work (i.e. January).
                              This means, to do original research, you probably need to have started the Fall 
                              of your Junior year. But, a lot of professors (... I'm like this too typically)
                              can't easily integrate you into a research project until you have taken 
                              prerequisite courses. This is why it's really hard to have a paper or more than 
                              one really strong letter.  How the hell are you supposed to have taken all these 
                              classes, met these professors, gotten lucky with things working out, put together
                              the app, etc all in time?!  You probably can't, but that doesn't mean you're 
                              unqualified or shouldn't apply. I'm describing "an ideal" world, and we're all 
                              gonna just try our best!

                            We probably need to discuss how "rounds" work at LTI/RI.  There is an admissions

                            filtering <b><i>before </i></b> the rest of the faculty ever gets a chance to see 
                            your application.  For sake of simplicity, here is a <b>simplified caricature</b>

                            TL;DR -- Most faculty won't see the full pool of applications, only those in 
                            Round 3.  This set becomes available to us in ~mid to to late January.  
                            Participating in Round 3/Shortlist are optional. Some advisors may simply wait to 
                            see who shows up in the Fall.  I look and try to indicate preferences well in

                            for personalized feedback.  There are many similar programs advertised every 
                            year.  You're hoping to show that you really understand the subfield, have 
                            experience, and know why you're applying (including who you mention in your SoP).
                            It can feel like being broad makes you more flexible, but it can also mean nobody
                            is particularly excited about your application. It's a balance.  You don't need or
                            want to lay out the title of your thesis in your SoP, but we also don't want 
                            something like "I like all of robotics", because, well, we can't do much with that.

                            <b>The Impossibly Strong Packet</b> The strongest letter is one that speaks to your 
                            ability to do the job you're applying for.  In this case, that job is research in 
                            a PhD program.  So the "perfect" set of letters is three letters, all from people 
                            who the reviewer considers their peer, all giving detailed comments about your 
                            work together, your ability to work independently, ability to come up with 
                            interesting research questions/next steps, and how you perform compared to 
                            previous students they have worked with. This is a lot to ask for and most people 
                            will not have this.  The general rule of thumb here is to get letters "as close" to 
                            this as possible.  So your situation will very but here is a rough set with some 
                            notes.<br><br>

                                        A strong letter from them is a big win but they have advised a lot
                                        of people, so if your letter says very little about you, or your 
                                        project, they will likely have to say you're in the bottom X% of 
                                        applicants, and that's not useful.

                                    letter doesn't hurt you, but it also doesn't help. It's a no-op. If there

                                    so this does not help and can hurt. This person obviously can't say they 
                                    would take you as their own student, so what we need is a comment about how
                                    you compare to other PhDs with whom they have worked or who went on to do 
                                    PhDs (and where those people did PhDs).  This person has a PhD and 
                                    so they should also compare you to people with whom they went to school. 
                                    These comparisons should be explicit.

                            If you have been asked to interview, congrats! This is big, regardless of the result.
                            This is not a "technical" interview in the way that tech companies will have you 
                            go to a whiteboard, etc.  This interview serves a few purposes:

                                understand the work you did,
                                the field you're hoping to pursue, and can hold a research conversation.  Think
                                of this a bit like an extension of your statement of purpose, except where
                                you probably got help crafting that, this is pure you and so an opportunity to
                                set yourself apart as insightful.</li>
                              <li><b>Do we have a similar vision?</b> We might broadly be interested in 
                                similar topics, but when we start to discuss the next 3-5 years, do we have 
                                compatible visions for what some of the big open questions are that we think
                                are worth tackling?</li>
                              <li><b>Do we get along?</b> The PhD averages a bit over 5 years.  That's a long
                                time to be in meetings with someone you don't click with.  Hopefully, in this

                            It's complicated.  In this space, we are looking for two things: 
                            <ol>
                              <li>Research experience/knowledge</li>

                            </ol>
                            <b>Experience/Knowledge</b> this is relatively straight forward.  If you are first
                            author on a paper at an impressive venue (and your letter corroborates that you
                            were in fact the project lead), then we know you are someone who can come up with
                            research questions and execute on them.  Pretty simple. If you are second, third,
                            ... author these tend not to be that meaningful. Unless the letter says otherwise,
                            we will assume that you helped but were mostly following directions.  Relatedly,
                            a common mistake is trying to get "lots of little papers" in random venues.  
                            Don't do this. This is directly at odds with demonstrating knowledge of the area. 
                            Specifically, if you are well versed in the state-of-the-art, then you know where 
                            it is being published and a single paper in that venue means a lot more than lots
                            of papers in a 3rd tier.  Similarly, a strong workshop paper at an important venue
                            means more (and will probably give you an opportunity to meet relevant people)
                            than a 3rd tier venue.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Leveraging Resources</b> "cool cool" this all stinks you think to yourself.
                            People at my school don't publish in those venues, advisors don't have graduate 
                            students to advise/help me, ... we try to take this into account. All the same
                            advise still holds, you do want to target the primary venues, etc. but lots of 
                            programs will expect more research output from someone in a big top research 
                            university and lab.  That doesn't mean you're off the hook if you don't have 
                            those resources, you have to demonstrate an equal level of commitment and
                            interest in the field.  This might mean being the first undergraduate that 
                            professor has written a submission with.  It might mean taking way more courses
                            than usual to create (for example) a sort of NLP minor out of a mixture of CS,
                            Linguistics, and Math classes. We need something that demonstrates a mature 
                            knowledge of the field, ability to conduct research, and that if provided with 
                            more resources you would thrive. An additional important note here: <b>We do not 
                              compare Bachelors to Masters.  Different bars.</b>
